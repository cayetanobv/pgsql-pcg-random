# PCG Random Number Generation, Minimal C Edition

[PCG-Random website]: http://www.pcg-random.org

This code provides a minimal implementation of one member of the PCG family
of random number generators, which are fast, statistically excellent,
and offer a number of useful features.

Full details can be found at the [PCG-Random website].  This version
of the code provides a single family member and skips some useful features
(such as jump-ahead/jump-back) -- if you want a more full-featured library,
you may prefer the full version of the C library, or for all features,
the C++ library.
